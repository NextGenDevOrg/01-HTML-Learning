      5 SIGNS THAT SAY YOU'RE A CAR ENTHUSIAST
    </h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center">
      <em>How many of this applies to you?</em>
    </h2>
    <h2 style="color: gray; text-align: left">
      There are many signs that say you’re a car enthusiast: <br />the
      encyclopedic knowledge of car brands and models, the meticulous care you
      provide to your car, and the tendency to ruin other people’s conversations
      with brutally technical car talk, just to name a few. Here are 5 other
      signs that give you away as a car nerd:
    </h2>
    <h2>
      1. YOU PREFER TO DO THINGS MANUALLY<br />
      <i>
        you know how to do it or not, there’s just an allure to using a manual
        transmission. Sure a dual-clutch transmission can do things a little bit
        faster, but there’s just something more fun about manual transmissions.
        The act of changing gears makes the relationship between you and the car
        more personal, as if you’re the rider and the car is the horse. Every
        depression of the clutch and the shifting of the gear lever through its
        various gates remind you that you are driving, and not just getting to
        one place. And you also do this for some reason…</i
      >
    </h2>

      style="margin: 40px"
      alt="gear box"
    />

    <h2>
      2. YOU PERK UP WHEN YOU HEAR CAR CONVERSATIONS<br />
      <i
        >Sure your cousin’s new baby is cute and the amount of diaper changes,
        and eventual baby-proofing to the apartment makes for interesting small
        talk. However, you can’t help but notice the conversation brewing in the
        corner of the party about turbo swaps, engine tuning, and tactics to
        defeat emission tests at the inspection station.</i
      >
    </h2>

      style="margin: 40px"
      alt="suricata"
    />

    <h2>
      3. YOU INTERJECT WITHOUT BEING ASKED<br />
      <i
        >Once you make your way to that car conversation, you interject without
        being asked. There’s a chance they don’t know how turbochargers work or
        how you almost bought that E46 M3 but decided the Volkswagen GTI was
        “just a better deal,” it’s better to be safe than sorry!</i
      >
    </h2>
    <br />

    <h2>
      4. YOU FEEL AN INSTANT BOND WITH THE PERSON DRIVING THE SAME CAR AS YOU<br />
      <i
        >In one glance you know that you and the stranger would be best buds if
        you knew each other. The both of you made the same great
        decision/mistake in choosing the car you’re driving, and fate has
        brought the two of you together for this short journey on the road.
        Sometimes you look over and nod. Sometimes you take the extra effort to
        roll down the window and throw a wave and a quick rev. The EVO and
        WRX/STI-bros have it the worst, because if they don’t wave at each
        other, kittens will die.</i

      5. ENGINE REVS AND EXHAUST NOTES GIVE YOU EAR-BONERS<br />
      <i
        >Why else would you roll down the window and rev your engine in a
        tunnel? Why else would you chase down that supercar that just passed you
        on the highway? And what other reason can you think of for downshifting
        and rev matching? You tell others you wanted to stay in the powerband,
        but you really wanted to feed your ears with some sweet howls of
        whatever it is that’s hiding in the engine bay. And speaking of
        ear-boners, here’s one for the history books</i
